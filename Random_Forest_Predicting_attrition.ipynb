        "### What is Random Forest?\n",
        "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction (for regression problems) or the mode prediction (for classification problems) of the individual trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Decision Trees Basics\n",
        "A decision tree makes decisions by splitting the data based on feature values. For a regression tree with a dataset $(X, Y)$ where $X$ represents features and $Y$ represents the target value:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The algorithm seeks to find the split that minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE):\n",
        "   $$SSE = \\sum_{i \\in left}(y_i - \\bar{y}_{left})^2 + \\sum_{i \\in right}(y_i - \\bar{y}_{right})^2$$\n",
        "   \n",
        "   where $\\bar{y}_{left}$ and $\\bar{y}_{right}$ are the mean values in the left and right nodes after the split.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Random Forest Algorithm\n",
        "Random Forest extends decision trees through:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Training each tree on a random sample with replacement from the original dataset.\n",
        "   - If our original dataset has $n$ observations, each bootstrap sample also has $n$ observations, but some observations may be repeated and some may be left out.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Feature Randomization**: At each split in each tree, only considering a random subset of features.\n",
        "   - If there are $m$ features, typically we consider $\\sqrt{m}$ features at each split.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ensemble Prediction**: For regression, the final prediction is the average of predictions from all trees:\n",
        "   $$\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\hat{y}_b$$\n",
        "   where $B$ is the number of trees and $\\hat{y}_b$ is the prediction from the $b$-th tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Advantages of Random Forest\n",
        "1. **Reduced Overfitting**: By averaging multiple trees, the model reduces variance while maintaining low bias\n",
        "2. **Feature Importance**: Provides a measure of the importance of each feature\n",
        "3. **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimation**: Built-in validation using samples not included in individual tree training\n",
        "4. **Handles Non-linear Relationships**: Effectively captures complex patterns in data\n",
        "5. **Robust to Outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme values than linear models\n",
        "\n",
        "### Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimation\n",
        "When building each tree, approximately 1/3 of the data is not used (out-of-bag). These samples can be used to estimate model performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For each observation $(x_i, y_i)$, find all trees where this observation was OOB\n",
        "2. Average the predictions from these trees for $x_i$\n",
        "3. Calculate the error between this prediction and $y_i$\n",
        "4. Average these errors across all observations\n",
        "\n",
        "This provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance without requiring a separate validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Majority Voting\n",
        "In Random Forest classification:\n",
        "- Each tree \"votes\" for a class\n",
        "- The final prediction is the class with the most votes (majority voting)\n",
        "\n",
        "For regression, the equivalent is taking the average of all tree predictions.\n",
